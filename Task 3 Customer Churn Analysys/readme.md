### Here is the background information on your task
A few weeks after presenting your dashboard to the management, the Retention Manager from the telecom reaches out to you directly. He was impressed by your work and asked if you can put together a dashboard about customer retention.

In addition, to better understand the data, the telecom Retention Manager has scheduled a meeting with the engagement partner at PwC to cover these points:

Customers in the telecom industry are hard-earned: we don’t want to lose them
The retention department is here to get customers back in case of termination 
Currently, we get in touch after they have terminated the contract, but this is reactionary: it would be better to know in advance who is at risk 
We  have done customer analysis with Excel: it has always ended in a dead-end
We would like to know more about our customers: visualised clearly so that it’s self-explanatory for our management
The Retentions Manager has provided some information, have a look through the resource section.

### Here is your task
Your colleague, the engagement partner, asks you to do the following tasks:

Define proper KPIs
Create a dashboard for the retention manager reflecting the KPIs
Write a short email to him (the engagement partner) explaining your findings, and include suggestions as to what needs to be changed

Subject: Analysis Report and Recommendations
Dear Janet,
I trust this email finds you in good health. 
I want to extend my sincere gratitude for providing me with valuable insights and data. Your input has been instrumental in helping me analyze our customer data effectively.
Based on my analysis, I would like to share the following key findings:

1.	Customer Overview: We currently have a total of 7,043 customers. Out of these, 1,869 have churned, accounting for approximately 26% of our customer base. Notably, the distribution of churned customers is relatively even between males and females within the given dataset. Gender does not appear to significantly impact churn rates.
2.	Contract: Customers with monthly contracts have the highest proportion of churn. I recommend implementing a strategy to retain these customers, such as providing promotions to incentivize them to stay after the first month.
3.	Device Protection: The number of customers with and without device protection is roughly equal, indicating that this service may not be a major factor in churn rates.
4.	Internet Service: A significant portion of Fiber Optic users has churned. It is advisable to conduct an audit, improve the quality of the service, and potentially offer discounts to existing users to reduce churn rates.
5.	Dependents: Churn rates are notably higher among customers who do not have dependents. Targeted strategies to retain this group may be necessary.
6.	Multiple Lines: Surprisingly, customers with multiple lines (service) have a higher proportion of churn. Understanding and addressing the reasons for this is essential.
7.	Online Backup: Churn rates are relatively equal among customers with and without online backup services.
8.	Online Security: A significant number of customers who do not have online security services have churned. We should consider promoting this service.
9.	Paperless Billing: Paperless billing customers have a higher churn rate. Offering discounts or incentives to retain this group should be explored.
10.	Payment Method: The highest churn rates are observed among customers who use electronic checks as their payment method. We must focus on retaining these customers..
11.	TechSupport: The most significant churn rate is observed among customers who do not have TechSupport services. Promoting this service can help improve retention rates.
These insights provide a solid foundation for crafting targeted strategies to reduce churn and improve customer retention. I look forward to discussing these findings further and working on the necessary actions to address these challenges.
Thank you once again for your support and guidance. Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or would like to discuss this in more detail.

Best regards,
Kasym Mankeyev, Data Analyst.
